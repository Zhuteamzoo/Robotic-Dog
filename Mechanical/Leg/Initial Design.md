# Initial Design

## Concept
For the robotic dogs leg design, I will move the knee joint motor closer to the hip to reduce the amount of torque necessary from the hip motor. 
In total each leg will have 2 motors, 1 to control the knee and 1 to control the hip. The third motor in Boston Dynamic's Spot design does not look important for the project that I have 
it intended to do. Since it won't navigate harsh terrains or need to recover from a heavy fall.

## Knee motor
To transfer the spin from the knee motor all the way down to the knee join I will have a timing belt from the motor all the way down to the joint. I find that Boston Dynamics design is to heavy and expensive
for my design.
