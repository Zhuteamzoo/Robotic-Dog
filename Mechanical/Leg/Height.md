# How heigh will the leg need to be

I will take the average measure of the table and countertops at my house and see how tall the leg should be. On top of that I will compare that to Boston Dyanmics height.

|Object|Height|

|Spot, Default Height(Walking)|610mm|
|Spot, Sitting|191mm|
|Max Height Walking|700mm|
|Min Height Walking|520mm|
|Stool next to my bed|750mm|
|My Desk|750mm|
|Dining Table|760mm|
|1 Step of Stair|200mm|
|Kitchen Counter Top|920mm|
