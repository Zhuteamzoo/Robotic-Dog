# How heigh will the leg need to be

I will take the average measure of the table and countertops at my house and see how tall the leg should be. On top of that I will compare that to Boston Dyanmics height.

|Object|Height|
|------|------|
|Spot, Default Height(Walking)|610mm|
|Spot, Sitting|191mm|
|Max Height Walking|700mm|
|Min Height Walking|520mm|
|Stool next to my bed|750mm|
|My Desk|750mm|
|Dining Table|760mm|
|1 Step of Stair|200mm|
|Kitchen Counter Top|920mm|

We can see from these results that most of the tables in my house and probably most households is 750mm, but making the dog tall has some cons and some pros

## Pros of having a tall dog

He's going to be able to reach high places and take bigger steps which might help him going up stairs.

## Cons of having a tall dog

It's going to be harder to balance the dog and make it walk since it's taller

---

We can see that from these results that I'll need a tall enough robot to reach certain places, but also take into account it's balance and stability.
For the height I think the optimal height would be 600mm when standing idle and when he's standing at his tallest maybe around ~650mm or more. This makes it so that his claw can reach most tables while
still optimizing his stability.
