# Robotic Dog — Milestone Plan 🐾🤖

## Milestone 0 — Project Setup
- [X] Create repository structure
- [X] Define safety rules (kill switch, safe pose)

---

## Milestone 1 — Robotic Claw
- [ ] Assemble claw mechanism
- [ ] Open / close control
- [ ] Smooth motion (no jerking)
- [ ] Grip safety limit
- [ ] Optional manual control (button / joystick)

---

## Milestone 2 — Single Leg Prototype
- [ ] Build one leg (2-DOF or 3-DOF)
- [ ] Define neutral pose
- [ ] Lift / extend / return sequence
- [ ] Angle limits enforced
- [ ] Repeat movement reliably

---

## Milestone 3 — Four-Leg Stand (Static Balance)
- [ ] Duplicate leg ×4
- [ ] Symmetrical mounting
- [ ] Per-leg calibration
- [ ] Stable standing pose
- [ ] Emergency stop works

---

## Milestone 4 — Basic Walking
- [ ] Crawl gait (one leg at a time)
- [ ] Flat-floor only
- [ ] Pause between steps
- [ ] Fall-safe stop behavior

---

## Milestone 5 — Core “Brain” (Safety & Power)
- [ ] Battery voltage monitoring
- [ ] Power thresholds defined
- [ ] Low-power mode
- [ ] Action denial when unsafe
- [ ] Status reporting

---

## Milestone 6 — Voice Control
- [ ] Voice input working
