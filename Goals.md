# Goals

Here are some of the things that I want the robotic dog to have. Some of these features might not be added this is just brainstorming.
- Roboti Claw
- Fully autonomous:
It will go search for sunlight in the house so that it can recharge itself
It will go search for tasks to do once its battery is full
- Voice controlled:
It will follow all instructions given to it. If it's charging and hasn't reached a set thereshold it will politely deny the request for safety reasons so that it doesn't die
- Versatile:
Must be able to navigate obstacles and go up and down stairs with ease.
